# Data-Visualisation
a comprehensive visual data exploration for ChrisCo, a fictional company managing retail outlets across the UK.
 I explored various aspects of the company's operations using Python Notebook in Colab . 📈
🔍 The dataset I worked with includes multiple CSV files specific to each student on the module. These files provided valuable information about ChrisCo's outlets, such as daily customer visits, annual marketing spend, overhead costs, outlet size, and staff employment. Each outlet is identified by a unique three-letter code.
